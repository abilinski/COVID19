devtools::load_all()

# load_parameters defaults to loading the base case
# it can be used to load other pre-defined intervention scenarios as well

# check its documentation at ?load_parameters
# you can get other scenarios with e.g. load_parameters(scenario = 2) 

# you can see all the pre-defined intervention scenarios available
# by looking at load_parameters_table() 

# if certain predefined scenarios (defined or not yet defined)
# would be useful to show every state / stakeholder that wants to
# see a report, let's talk about what those should be and how to
# work them in 

# at this point the default parameters are optimized for Santa Clara County,
# so not widely applicable to every jurisdiction - but used here for example.
params <- load_parameters()

# The parameters must be taken from here modified to match the setting we want
# to generate a report for. 
# 
# One would do this by running something like 
# params$n <- 123,456 # total population size
# params$td <- 3 # doubling time in days
# 
# I would recommend not hardcoding these, but rather using Rmarkdown parameters
# https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-6.html
# 
#
# note that in our approach, the per contact transmission probability p and 
# R0 are defined based off of the doubling time td parameter


# how to run the model - base case: 
simulation_outcomes <- run_param_vec(params = params, params2=NULL,
  days_out1 = 30, days_out2 = NULL, model_type = run_basic)

# before running an intervention scenario, one should modify 
# define the intervention parameter vector

# two ways to do this: 
# example 1:  school closing as defined in parameters.csv / load_parameters_table
intervention_params_1 <- load_parameters(2) 

# example 2:  manually define the intervention parameters
# shortcut: take the default parameters and modify them
intervention_params_2 <- params
params$s <- .5 # move half of people to socially distanced compartments


# how to run the model - intervention scenario: 
simulation_outcomes_intervention <- 
  run_param_vec(params = params, params2 = intervention_params_2, days_out1 = 10,
    days_out2 = 30, model_type = run_int)


# we can take those simulation outcomes and feed them into the make_plots_int function

  simulation_outcomes_intervention, intervention_params_1)

#### Overview

The Covid-19 Statistics, Policy and Epidemiology Collective (**C-SPEC**) developed a transmission model to project Covid-19 cases in 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
print(locality)
```
. Using data available on 

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
print(Data_Date)
```
, we produced the following estimates for daily and cumulative case counts in
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
print(locality)
```
under various scenarios. 


## Daily Covid-19 Case Counts 
Projected daily case counts for 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
print(locality)
```
, with an R0 of 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
print(R0)
```
and without social distancing (see below, **Model Fitting**)

## Cumulative Covid-19 Infections

Here are six scenarios for cumulative case projections over the next 60 days. Scenarios show possibilities for percentage of Covid-19 cases detected in 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
print(locality)
```
(5%, 15% or 2% of total cases detected), each considering two percentages of asymptomatic cases (25% and 50%).

## Interpretation

These figures reflect the current state of cases reported to 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
print(locality)
```
. Please keep in mind that these cases were likely infected around 14 days before becoming symptomatic. Therefore, cases reported to date were likely infected before stringent social distancing measures were established. With continued social distancing, the rate of infection (see below, **Model Fitting**) will likely decrease, and projected infections will likely decrease.

Maintaining social distancing at this stage is crucial to preserving health care capacity, in terms of facilities, equipment, supplies, and workforce. Slowing the rate of infection will alleviate pressure on the daily operations of health care facilities and personnel, in addition to saving lives.

## Outlook

If social distancing decreases the rate of infection by 10% over the next two weeks, daily case counts are projected to improve:

If social distancing decreases the rate of infection by 20% over the next two weeks, daily case counts are projected to further improve:


## Model Fitting

We fitted a dynamic transmission model to data received by 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
print(locality)
```
on 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
print(Data_Date)
```
. The estimated rate of infection, based on the 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
print(Days_Fit)
```
most recent days of data collection, is 
```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
print(R0)
```
.

## Including Plots

######You can also embed plots, for example:

######```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
######plot(pressure)
######```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
